## Getting started

You need to have the `Dart SDK` installed on your computer (with version between 2.13.0 included and 3.0.0 excluded).

You will also have to activate `webdev` with `dart pub global activate webdev`.

Then you will need to get all of the dependencies: `dart pub get`.

Finally, you can run the dev server with `webdev serve {folder}` to serve a folder (by default the folder is `web`)

## Examples

You can find examples of animations built with Manim-Web [here](https://manim-web.github.io/manim-web/).
The code is available in this repository, in the `example` folder.

You can also serve examples with `webdev serve example`
